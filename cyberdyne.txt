Millions of people around the world use a network. It has become a quintessential part of our lives. A network visualization tool is a tool that maps your IP address to that of the desired destination and visualizes this setup with the use of Google Earth. Network visualization has become an integral part of our lives these days. Every organization, or individual is switching to this kind of technology, as it helps it get all things done in an easier way. 
A lot of people are familiar with the concept of geolocation, but they might not know that it's also a useful tool for mapping IP addresses. Mapping IP addresses allows you to find out where a particular device is located in relation to other devices. When you're looking at network traffic, this can help you see which parts of the network are being used by different devices.
CYBERDYNE is something of a similar kind. Itâ€™s a network traffic mapping tool that provides you a hands-free experience to map your source IP address to the destination IP address. The motive behind CYBERDYNE was to learn how the backend of GOOGLE EARTH works when it comes to processing kml files for portrayal of geolocations on earth. This Network Traffic Visualization tool can be implemented by using applications like Google Earth, Wireshark, GeoLite City and most importantly Python.
